            <p>Welcome to my 3DS homebrew guide. This guide assumes that you have never installed homebrew before but can handle basic file management. Currently every device in the 3DS family is supported.</p>

            <p>Before beggining, it is important to understand what homebrew is and what you can do with it installed. Homebrew is a term commonly used to describe unofficial software. It includes various system utilities, as well as games and emulators. Virtually all of this software is freely available online for download and can add extra functionality to the system.</p>

            <p>This guide covers the process of installing the custom firmware (CFW) and core utilities, such as the Homebrew Launcher and FBI, needed for running other homebrew software. There are two methods explained, and the one you choose depends on if you have access to a flash cart such as on of the R4i carts.</p>
            <p>Here are some things to consider before starting:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>What system are you using? (3DS, 2DS, New 3DS, New 2DS)</li>
                <li>What data do you need to back up?</li>
                <li>Do you have a SD/microSD card? (If you are using a flash cart you will need a seperate microSD card for it)</li>
                <li>Do you have a desktop or laptop that can transfer files to an SD/microSD card?</li>
                <li>Do you accept the risk of potentially bricking your system? (This is extremely rare, and shouldn't happen if follow the guide properly.)</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="info">
                <p>Make sure your device is up to date before starting this guide. At the time of writing the latest version is 11.9. Hover over this box to see how to check your device version and update.</p>

                <div class="hidden">
                    <p>To check your device version and update:</p>

                    <ol>
                        <li>Open System Settings</li>
                        <li>Find your system's version on the top screen in the bottom right corner. If it is up to date, it should ve Sys 11.9.0-XU. (The X is the version of the system browser, which may be used later depending on the methong you choose)</li>
                        <li>To update, tap Other Setting</li>
                        <li>Scroll to the fourth page and tap System Update</li>
                        <li>Press OK, and I Accept, then wait for the system to finish updating.</li>
                    </ol>
                </div>
            </div>

            <p>First things first, make sure you create a backup of all your save data. To do this, open the settings and tap Data Management. Then, tap Save-Data Backup and backup each individual file. If you own any digital games, they will be already be saved to the SD card.</p>

            <p>Once this process is done, turn off the system and insert the system's SD card into a computer. Create a <code>3DS</code> folder on your desktop where we can store all of the files we need for this guide. Then, make a folder inside of it called <code>BACKUP</code>, and copy the contents of the SD card into the folder.</p>
