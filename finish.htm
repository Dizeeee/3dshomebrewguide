            <p>Congratulations! You now have homebrew installed on your device! All you need to do now is find software that you want to use. This may be emulators, homebrew games, themes, or anything else you can find out there. There are plenty of good places to find software, and it doesn't seem like there's really any one place for you to download everything (yet), but here's a good list of places to start:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    <a href="https://wiki.gbatemp.net/wiki/List_of_3DS_homebrew">GBATemp Wiki</a> - This list is one of the more extensive ones, covering a wide variety of software. This list does not provide QR codes to install any of the software so you'll have to do it manually.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <a href="https://www.3dbrew.org/wiki/Homebrew_Applications">3DBrew Wiki</a> - This Guide is similar in scope to the GBATemp wiki, however it has some software such as game engines and homebrew games that aren't linked on GBATemp.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <a href="https://tinydb.eiphax.tech/">TinyDB</a> - By far the easiest way to find and install software, TinyDB provides a relatively short list of software with QR codes that can be used in FBI to download software.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <a href="https://themeplaza.eu/themes">Themeplaza</a> - The largest theme site for the 3DS, if you have the Anemone theme manager installed, you can scan QR codes to easily customize your system.
                </li>
            </ul><p></p>
